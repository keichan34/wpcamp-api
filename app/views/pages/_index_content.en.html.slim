  | Welcome to the (unofficial) WordCamp API.
p
  | The WordCamp API aims to provide you with machine-readable information of the most recent WordCamps around the world.
p
  | The API is free to use, and this project is run as a hobby, so please don't ping us more than a couple times a day. If you'd like to donate (read: ensure this service is fast and responsive :) ), please send some bitcoins over to <a href="bitcoin:1239L7WWS29oFb9vQKgWKYF9ky9ptRyFyF">1239L7WWS29oFb9vQKgWKYF9ky9ptRyFyF</a> !

      {
        "wordcamps": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "guid": "http://central.wordcamp.org/?post_type=wordcamp&p=1239054",
            "url": "http://2014.atlanta.wordcamp.org",

                "end": "2014-03-15"

    code
      | /v1/wordcamps/search.json?q=[query]
  p
    | A very basic search mechanism. Searches through the WordCamp titles and descriptions.
.api-section
  h3
    code
      | /v1/wordcamps/location/[location].json
  p
    | Returns a list of WordCamps for the given location, sorted in reverse date order (most recent will come first).
  .example
    pre
      | /v1/wordcamps/location/tokyo.json
  p
    | Additional attributes that are accepted by this endpoint:
  dl.dl-horizontal
    dt include_banners
    dd If this attribute is present, the response will include additional promotional banner information for each object.
    dt year
    dd Filters the response by year.
  p
    | The response is the same format as the main list. This is faster and more deterministic than the basic search API.
.api-section
  h3
    code
      | /v1/wordcamps/:id.json
  p
    | Using the <code>id</code> parameter from the above responses, you can request information about a specific WordCamp. Right now, the response data is the same.
